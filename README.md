# Make_Folders_From_Files
Application that scans files in a folder (not including the subfolders). Then for each file, it creates a folder with the same name as the file. Finally, move each file into its relevant folder.
This can be used, for batch processing, to move individual files into separate folders. For example, to prepare a directory for Plex server where it is preferred to have each media file in a separate folder.
